There will be a technical guide for those who do not know hoe to use git and github.


To maintain coherence and ensure the best experience for everyone, please follow these rules:

- Respect the Existing Lore: While creativity is encouraged, make sure your contributions fit within the established world. Ensure your additions do not contradict existing stories or rules. Use the Concepts and Rules of the World section for guidance.
